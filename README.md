#File Metadata Microservice

A full stack JavaScript app built using Node.js, Express, with Bootstrap for the (minimal!) front end, that fulfills the following user stories:

1. User Story: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

2. User Story: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

Built for the File Metadata Microservice API Project at Free Code Camp.

A running version of the app can be found at http://ecc-filemetadata-ms.herokuapp.com/
